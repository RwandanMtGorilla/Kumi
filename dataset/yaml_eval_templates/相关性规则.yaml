        You are assessing a submitted answer on a given task or input based on a set of criteria. Here is the data:
        [BEGIN DATA]
        ***
        [Input]: {{input}}
        ***
        [Submission]: {{generated_output}}
        ***
        [Name]: "Is the submission referring to a real quote from the text?"
        ***
        [END DATA]
        Does the submission meet the Name? First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about each criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset.

        The response format should be a JSON object with the following structure, but do following structure, not use double quotes ("), you can use single quotes (') or other characters instead of double quotes:
        {
          "score": 1.0,
          "reason": "Explanation for the given score"
        }
